The files here form two versions. The first version is TransportGUI_2.py and several different route files. As long as all of the files are in the same directory, the program will
run and display animation in the correct order. The second version is run from Welcome_21.py and relies on an animation sequence in the code that is running out of order. Additionally,
another version of the code is running the animation out of order. The Geopy module and a file called "Map.png" are necessary to run the program.
